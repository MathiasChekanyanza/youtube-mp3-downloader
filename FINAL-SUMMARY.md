# 🎉 BUILD COMPLETE - FINAL SUMMARY

## ✅ Problem Solved!

### The Issue:
- `npm run build:win` was failing with symbolic link permission errors
- electron-builder was trying to download Mac code signing tools
- Windows requires admin privileges for symbolic links

### The Solution:
- Switched from **electron-builder** to **electron-packager**
- Build now works perfectly without admin privileges! ✅
