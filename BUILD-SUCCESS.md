## ⚠️ Why electron-builder Failed

**Issue**: Windows symbolic link permissions
- electron-builder tries to extract Mac signing tools (even for Windows builds)
- Windows requires admin rights to create symbolic links
- This causes the build to fail

**Solution Used**: 
- Switched to `electron-packager` ✅
- Simpler, no signing complications
- Works perfectly for distribution
